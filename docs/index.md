Shopify App CLI helps you build Shopify apps faster. It automates many common tasks in the development process and lets you quickly add popular features, such as billing and webhooks.

## Project types

The CLI can create and help manage different kinds of Shopify projects. There are two types of projects you can create:

1. Node.js app -- 
2. Ruby on Rails app

The `create` command will scaffold a new Shopify project in your current active directory and generate all the necessary starter files.

```sh
$ shopify create
? What type of project would you like to create? (Choose with ↑ ↓ ⏎, filter with 'f')
> 1. Node.js App
  2. Ruby on Rails App
```

Each project type has its own set of commands to speed up your development process.

To get started, look at the [prequisites and installation instructions](/setup/).
