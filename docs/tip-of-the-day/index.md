The Tip of the day feature provides useful advice relating to CLI and Shopify app development. We'll only show one tip per day and we keep track of tips you've already seen so you won't see the same again. We frequently update the tips list to give the latest Shopify news.

```console
┏━━ Tip of the Day ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
┃ ⭑ Creating a new store and need some sample products? 
┃   Try the `populate` command: https://shopify.github.io/shopify-app-cli/app/rails/commands/#populate
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

You can disable them using `config` in [core commands](https://shopify.github.io/shopify-app-cli/core/#tipoftheday).
