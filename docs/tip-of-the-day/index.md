The Tip of the day feature provides useful advice relating to CLI and Shopify app development in general.

If you prefer not see these tips, you can [disable them](https://shopify.github.io/shopify-app-cli/core/#tipoftheday)

We'll only show one tip per day to avoid overwhelming you. We'll begin with easier tips and move on once you have more interactions with the CLI. And we keep track of tips you've already seen so you won't see the same again.

We frequently update the tips list to give the latest Shopify news.
