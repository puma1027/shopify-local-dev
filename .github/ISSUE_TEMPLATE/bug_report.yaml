        Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for taking the time to open an issue.

        *Before submitting your issue*, please ensure that:

        1. You've searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-cli/issues) to see if someone else has already submitted the same thing. (Feel free to add any additional information in a comment!)
        2. You've given as much detail as reasonably possible
        3. You're working with the [latest CLI version](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-cli/releases)

        This is important because:

        1. We will notice and prioritize 1 popular issue more quickly than many small duplicates
        2. More details = faster, higher-quality response
        3. We might have fixed your issue already!
